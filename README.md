Keylogger

This is a python 2.7 keylogger. It was written as a test exercise for myself. 

NOTE: Porting this to python 3 will cause the victim machine to CRAWL, to the points its unusable. Unsure why this happens.

To turn this into a self contained exe instead of a python scrips:

>pip install pyinstaller
>
>pyinstaller keylogger.py

Easy peasy. 

Name was suggested by github, thought Id take it because why not.
